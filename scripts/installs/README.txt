srod/dotfiles - Scripts for Package Installs 📥
-------------------------------------------------

Each of these scripts is used to automate the installation and updates of packages, across various OSs
Specific usage instructions can be found in a comment, at the top of each file - read before running
Files can either be run directly, or can be invoked (based on system type) when you run install.sh
Be sure to check the contents of any file, and modify to your liking before executing anything
Currently only MacOS, Arch-based systems, Debian-based systems and Windows are supported
